# svalidator-play-sample
A play scala application showcasing the use of the SValidator library integration

The application has minimal configuration, and only uses the webjar for the Bootstrap framework to 
demonstrate the usage of svalidator for decoration of inputs.  Also, an HTML factory specifically tailored to Play! is
implemented to show how to integrate everything with Play's routes and CSRF filter.
